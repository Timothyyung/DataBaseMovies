# Movie Database Project
 Timothy yung</br>
CS333 Introduction to Databases

___________________________________________

## Project Goal
Databases are important to the functionality of everyday life. We use databases everyday whether it be shopping online or simply registering for a class. The goal of this project will be to go through the life cycle of designing a database (from an existing data set) to actually loading and implementing queries to run against it. In addition to creating queries we will also be optimizing them for their performance. In the design we will be creating an ER diagram and also generating schemas for them. For the testing phase, the data needs to be cleaned up since while the formatting is pretty consistent there are inconsistent delimiters used.

## The Data

|Entity|Description|Size|Data type|Number of Entries
|-----|----------------|---|---|---|
|Movies|List of movies inside the database from the year 1916 to 2010|21.9 kb| .txt|10681|
|Users| UserID of the database,We do not has access to user data in this particular set | N/A | .txt|5711|
|Genres| All the genres that a movie can have | N/A | .txt|19|
|Tags| Tags are generated by users and contains data about movies |3.3 MB | .txt|95580|
|Ratings | Ratings made by the user |235.1 MB | .txt|10000054|

# Loading the Database

>Instructions to run my queries:</br>
1) Generate the new files by running the make_files.py script in the old data folder (These files are already in the Data folder)</br>
2) Unzip the ratings file ( the file is too large to import into github normally )
3) Rename the paths in the copy command located in tyung-init.sql to the paths of the files on local computer. tyung-init.sql generates the tables and populates them
4) Run tyung-init.sql to run all the set up queries.
5) Run the tyung-query-part2.sql for part 2 code
6) Run the tyung-query-part3.sql for part 3 code

## What is in this github?

## Questions of about the data

### Find any null or invalid values in the dataset

In the script that generated the input for the database I exclude all invalid data types and null values so there would be no null or invalid data points inside my data base. After running the test this is shown to be true.

#### Sample Query:

 >select count(*) </br>
 from ratings </br>
 where movieid IS NULL or userid IS NULL or rating IS NULL or timestamp IS NULL;


### Find the distribution of the values for attribute "year" of table "movies".</br> ![Year Distribution Query Result (Click Me)](https://github.com/Timothyyung/DataBaseMovies/blob/master/images/yearcount.csv 'Year Table')

>select year, count(*)</br> 
from movies</br>
group by year;

## General Queries

### Find the most reviewed movie (that is, the movie with the highest number of reviews). Show the movie id, movie title and the number of reviews.
>select movieid, moviename, count(rating)<br>
>from ratings natural join movies<br>
>group by movieid, moviename<br>
>order by count(rating) DESC<br>
>limit 1;<br>

| movieid |  moviename   | count| 
|---------|--------------|-------|
|    296 | Pulp Fiction | 34864 |

### Without Index Plan and Execution time

Execution time: 28186.149 ms

### With Index on Movieid

Planning time: 0.318 ms<br>
Execution time: 13466.288 ms

Seems like the Index on movieid increased the performance by alot, This is becasue we are grouping by movieid and having a faster search for the movieid would allow us to do the aggrate functions faster.

### Find the highest reviewed movie (movie with the most 5-star reviews). Show the movie id, movie title and the number of reviews.

>select movieid, moviename,count(CASE WHEN rating = 5 THEN 1 END) as fcount<br>
>from ratings natural join movies<br>
>group by movieid, moviename<br>

## DeBiasing

### Find the difference between a user's rating and the average rating of the movie he has rated.

create table ratings_with_diff as (select ratings.movieid,ratings.userid,ratings.rating,ratings.timestamp,avg.avgrating, (ratings.rating - avg.avgrating) as difrating<br>
from ratings,<br>
(select movieid, (sum(rating)/count(rating)) as avgrating<br>
from ratings group by movieid) as avg<br>
where avg.movieid = ratings.movieid<br>
order by ratings.movieid);<br>

### Update the rating of users and find new difference 

update ratings_with_diff <br>
set rating = ratings_with_diff.avgrating<br>
where abs(difrating) > 3;

### Create New Ratings table

create table ratings_with_diff_2 as (select ratings.movieid,ratings.userid,ratings.rating,ratings.time,avg.avgrating, (ratings.rating - avg.avgrating) as difrating <br>
from ratings_with_diff as ratings,<br>
(select movieid, (sum(rating)/count(rating)) as avgrating<br>
from ratings_with_diff group by movieid) as avg<br>
where avg.movieid = ratings.movieid<br>
order by ratings.movieid);


### Repeat the Update

Repeat the above steps for x iterations 

### Find the average rating for each movie before the de-biasing

select moviename, r1.movieid, r1.avgrating, r2.avgrating, abs(r1.avgrating - r2.avgrating) as brating<br>
from ( select movieid, avg(rating) as avgrating from ratings_with_diff group by movieid) as r1,<br>
(select movieid, avg(rating) as avgrating from ratings_with_diff_2 group by movieid) as r2,<br>

## Analysis and Retrospective

### Assumptions I made E/R design

For the most part I assume that many of the movies would have at least one or more genres and that the data would be consistent with the tables. Most of the data would have many to many relationships with each other. Otherwise I thought contructing the E/R diagram was pretty straight forward.

### Errors/duplicates/redundancy you encountered when testing your database

One of the key things I noticed when doing the last query in which I had to create a new table for ratings_with_diff is that the average was written multiple times( the average was repeated quite a bit and could have been removed ) 

I understand it does make the subsequent operations much simpler but it is still considered redundant data and may cause issues if the data set were to be large enough,

### Indexing and run Time
 For the most part by adding indexes on the movieid the run time for most of my queries improved by alot. I would add an index on the movie id on both the ratings table ( this one was very useful since we are doing alot of searches on movie id for many of the problems) and the movies table itself.
 
 For the most part those were the only optimizations I had done to speed up the query process. Other optimizations I had done were to structure my sql queries better by limited the amount of times I would do a cartian product using subqueries to make smaller tables before joining them to the larger one.
 
 One of the key things I that I noticed when I swaped to using the dump file was that in my version of the database I declared primary keys which in postgres ment it would automatically index by those keys. While it was nice, those indexes actually cannot be dropped. I was able to to full experimentation on the indecies after I switched to the dump file.

## The percentage of unknown values in your attributes

To my knowledge there wasnt any unknown values in this data set
 
### Challenges 
 
For me I spent the most time cleaning the data using the python scripts. I thought it was interesting how to use regex and string matching to find the patterns and reconstruct them in a way to allow it to be read into my database. Aside from that some of the other struggles I had was matching the output to be the same as the ones given (mostly for the last question) as I initially debiased the data in a different way. ( First attempt was deleting the rows, Second attempt was to set them to 3.5)

One of the other more challenging queries was filtering the data by decade. While the sql query was relativly simpler than the ones in phase 3, it took me a while to figure out how to limit to the first 3 charaters of the year. In the end I did

year - (year%10) this took the year and subtracted the last digit to get the decade.
