\nCS333 Introduction to Databases

# Project Goal
  Databases are important to the functionality of everyday life. We use databases everyday whether it be shopping online or simply registering for a class. The goal of this project will be to go through the life cycle of designing a database (from an existing data set) to actually loading and implementing queries to run against it. In addition to creating queries we will also be optimizing them for their performance. In the design we will be creating an ER diagram and also generating schemas for them. For the testing phase, the data needs to be cleaned up since while the formatting is pretty consistent there are inconsistent delimiters used.
